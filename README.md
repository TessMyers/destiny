# sword-stone

A fantasy point-and-click puzzle game with a bit of text adventure thrown in. Play it here: https://tessmyers.github.io/sword-and-stone/

Game design, art, and development by me. This was my first browser-based game, and I'm going to be real with you: most of this code was smashed together over two weekends and I've done some things I'm not proud of.

Written with Vue.js and Typescript, in the sense that there are Typescript files and no errors. 

Enjoy!
