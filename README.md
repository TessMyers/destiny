# Destiny (NOTE: THIS IS A WIP! PLEASE COME BACK LATER)

A fantasy point-and-click puzzle game with a bit of text adventure thrown in.

Headphones recommended.

Game design, art, and development by me. This was my first browser-based game, and I'm going to be real with you: most of this code was smashed together over two weekends and I've done a few things I'm not proud of.

Written with Vue.js and Typescript, in the sense that there are Typescript files and no errors. Sounds were edited with Audacity, see [SFX credits](https://github.com/TessMyers/sword-and-stone/blob/master/SOUNDCREDITS.md) for full attribution list. 

Enjoy!

## Project setup
